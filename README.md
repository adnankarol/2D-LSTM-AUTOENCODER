# 2D-LSTM-AUTOENCODER
Introduction to 2 Dimensional LSTM Autoencoder
This is a continuation of my earlier repository where I use 1D LSTM for Autoencoder and Anomaly Detection.

To Define in basic terms an Autoencoder works in this way it takes an input sample, extracts all the important information (called as latent variable) , which also helps in elimanting noise and reconstructs back the input at the output with the help of the latent variable.
